```

It's often useful to perform the same operation on multiple columns, but copying and pasting is both tedious and error prone:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df %>% 
  group_by(g1, g2) %>% 
  summarise(a = mean(a), b = mean(b), c = mean(c), d = mean(d))
```

(If you're trying to compute `mean(a, b, c, d)` for each row, instead see `vignette("rowwise")`)

This vignette will introduce you to the `across()` function, which lets you rewrite the previous code more succinctly:
